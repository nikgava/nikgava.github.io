The project consists in the design of a custom motorbike referring to an existing one that my family have.

I started by taking all the measures I thought were necessary for the design. Then I started designing the wheel with its spokes, and then moved on to the brake disc and brake system.

The brake system was the most complicated thing to design, as I could not take measurements very easily and had somewhat complicated shapes. In addition, the part of assembling the brake caliper was particularly challenging.

The next part of the design was the forks, which were also quite complicated to draw, having no way to access the layout of the internal components. I oriented myself with designs found on the web.

The last part drawn was the handlebars with related components such as: brake levers, grips, headlight, etc..

All purchasable and standard parts were taken from some libraries, such as screws and bearings.

Finally I leave the 2D drawing of the motorcycle assembly in pdf:
