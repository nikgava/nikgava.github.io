## 1. Introduction  

This project aims to model a hydraulic system for an aircraft landing gear using OpenModelica software.  

The work began with research aimed at obtaining a broad overview of the various types and functions of these devices, then moved on to a survey of the state of the art of current hydraulic circuits in today's aircraft.  

This was followed by an initial modeling of a simple circuit on the software with continuous research on the data to be entered into the various components during modeling, trying to respect the actual operating conditions.  

The project is concluded by presenting the results obtained.

### 1.1 Landing Gear  

![Landing gear](/images/Landinggear.png){:.align-right width="300px"}
An aircraft landing gear is a mechanical system consisting of a retractable frame, mounted on wheels, that supports an aircraft when it is not in flight.  

Its purpose is to provide a suspension system during taxiing, takeoff and landing. It is designed to absorb and dissipate the kinetic energy of impact, thereby reducing the loads transmitted to the airframe.  

The landing gear is also largely responsible for braking the aircraft by means of a wheel braking system and provides directional control of the aircraft on the ground by means of a wheel steering system.  

This type of undercarriage is retracted into the fuselage or wings of the aircraft and allows a significant reduction in the aerodynamic drag generated by a fixed undercarriage. Current aircraft, both civil and military, all have retractable undercarriages. This construction solution has an obvious advantage from an aerodynamic point of view in terms of fuel consumption and comfort (less vibration and noise in flight), but it is also one that involves considerable construction complication, high construction and operating costs, and constant maintenance efforts.

### 1.2 Reference aircraft  

For this design study, the hydraulic system of an aircraft that is actually on the market and in operation was chosen, specifically the Airbus A320.

## 2. Components  

Referring to the Airbus A320 aircraft, components peculiar to the aircraft were researched, and where it was not possible to identify them, due to the paucity of data available, components compatible with range of use of the aircraft were analyzed and chosen.  

### 2.1 Pump  

The pumps that were selected for the landing gear and door circuit, from Parker's company catalog, are model AP10VC and AP6VSC, respectively, having the following characteristics:   

![Pump](/images/Pump.png){:.align-center width="500px"}  

|                 | AP10VC             | AP6VSC           |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Operating Pressure | 207 bar             | 207 bar           |
| Displacement    | 26.2 cm³           | 15.9 cm³         |
| Flow Rate       | 20 l/min           | 11 l/min         |
| Rotation Speed  | 760 rpm            | 700 rpm          |  

### 2.2 Actuator  

The main actuator (referring to the carriage) and secondary actuator (referring to the doors) were selected from FIMAC catalog model MED, characterizing data shown in tables below.  

| **LANDING GEAR ACTUATOR** |             |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Piston Diameter       | 148 mm      |
| Rod Diameter          | 98 mm       |
| Stroke                | 272 mm      |
| Displacement          | 4679 cm³    |
| Operating Fluid       | Skydrol     |  
|  |
| **DOOR ACTUATOR**         |             |
| Piston Diameter       | 96 mm       |
| Rod Diameter          | 63 mm       |
| Stroke                | 175 mm      |
| Displacement          | 1267 cm³    |
| Operating Fluid       | Skydrol     |  

### 2.3 Servo-valve  

The directional control valves used are Parker model D1V*004 with symbolic architecture shown below.  
![servovalcola](/images/servovalcola_stilizz.png){:.align-center width="350px"}  

### 2.4 Check valve  

Non-return valves model "category 3: one way, unfiltered, part No. 9R3512" from Crissair INC catalog were selected.  

This component allows free circulation of flow in one direction and circulation with restriction in the opposite direction: the direction of flow causes the displacement of a spool with ports, all of which are available in one direction and some of which are closed in the opposite direction due to the sealing of the conical seat.  

### 2.5 Operating fluid  

From literature and by comparing various offerings proposed by manufacturers and suppliers, "Skydrol" has been identified as the operating fluid. Since it is a fluid used on aircraft and thus also operates at near-zero temperatures, ISO-VG 46-3 fluid was chosen from the table below.  

![operatingfluid](/images/operatingfluid.png){:.align-center width="300px"}  

## 3. Design  

For the proper modeling of some components of the circuit, it was necessary to dimension and calculate some characteristics, which are collected in a few paragraphs below. The necessary data were found by referring directly to the Aircraft characteristics airport and maintenance planning document of the Airbus A320.  

Referring to literature and demonstration videos, the following operational timelines were estimated:  
- carriage closing/opening: about 8 seconds, a figure used in the simulation for a variety of components, including the period of aerodynamic force application.  
- interval (between the two phases): about 2 seconds to ensure complete closure of the carriage before the start of the door closing phase.  
- door closing/opening: about 5 seconds given used in the simulation for varied components, including the period of aerodynamic force application.  

### 3.1 Landing gear dimensions

![dimension](/images/dimension.png){:.align-center width="400px"}  

`Area front_gomma = 700 mm * 700 mm = 490000 mm² = 0,49 m²`  

`Area front_stelo = 2000 mm * 200 mm = 400000 mm² = 0,40 m²`  

`Afron = Area front_stelo + Area front_gomma = 0,89 m²`  

### 3.2 Aerodynamic Force  

It was necessary to perform an estimation of the aerodynamic force acting on the landing gear and doors that is exerted in the direction opposite to the forward speed of the aircraft.  

**Aerodynamic Force on the landing gear**
We take advantage of the calculation of area made in section 3.1 to be able to calculate the aerodynamic force acting on the trolley section. It is assumed that the aerodynamic force has direction parallel to the forward velocity being the most precautionary situation.  

$D=\frac{1}{2} \rho A_{\text {front }} C_D v_{\text {media }}{ }^2=2403 \mathrm{~N}$  

`D = 1/2 ρ A_front C_D v_media^2 = 2403 N`  

- ρ (Rho): Air Density: 1.2 Kg/m³
- A_front: Frontal Area: 0.89 m²
- C_D: Drag Coefficient: 0.8
- V_media: Average Velocity of the vehicle: 75 m/s  

**Aerodynamic Force on the doors**  

`D = C_corr * 1/2 * ρ * A_front * C_D * V_media^2 = 337 N`  

- ρ: Air Density: 1.2 Kg/m³
- A_front: Frontal Area: 0.104 m²
- C_D: Drag Coefficient: 0.8
- V_media: Average Vehicle Velocity: 75 m/s
- C_corr: Corrective Coefficient: 1.2

### 3.3 Pressure drop in the servo valve  

From Parker's catalog, the pressure drop of the valves was calculated using the graphs below. Using the flow rate of the incoming pump, 20 l/min, standing on the x-axis and crossing curves 1 and 2, the two corresponding pressure drops for the two different sections of forward P-B and P-A and return A-T and B-T are derived on the y-axis, which can be considered equal:
Pressure drop on curve 1 and 2; forward and return: 0.7 bar.
(The same pressure drop is also assumed for the door actuator valve, with a flow rate of 11 l/min, as a precautionary measure since it would turn out to be slightly less).

## 4. Modeling  

Through the use of OpenModelica software, it was possible to represent the hydraulics of the landing gear and doors using special libraries provided by the department. From the modeling point of view, it was decided to simulate the takeoff phase of the aircraft but similar considerations apply to the landing phase with simple adjustments in the timing of opening/closing valves, forces and actuators.  

Considering that the real circuit would be an electro-hydraulic circuit the electrical part was considered with the inclusion of signals regulating the actuation of the directional valves and the revolutions of the electric motors controlling the pumps.

## 5. Graphs  

The most significant graphs of the simulation are now reported and commented on, it is anticipated that any incorrections are to be considered due to omissions and approximations made on both lines.  

Outside of these considerations, however, one must keep in mind the quasi-ideal nature of the components chosen in the model, which quantitatively distance the results from reality.

## 6. Conlusion   

In this work, a hydraulic circuit of landing gear handling and related containment door of a real aircraft in the fleet, Airbus A320, was modeled. The design choices for the hydraulic system and signal handling were presented. The proposed model was also simulated to illustrate its proper operation.  

The model, although very simplified in that it does not fully consider many of the parameters involved, such as simplifying aerodynamic effects, and other secondary effects, still presents results qualitatively similar to reality.  

Further developments that can be implemented are:
- More accurate evaluation of aerodynamic effects;
- Inclusion of the various safety blocking systems;
- Consideration of distributed and concentrated losses in the various components;
- Insertion of additional components for more accurate simulation of processes (such as accumulator, filters, ...);
- Modification of modeling data for the landing phase.
