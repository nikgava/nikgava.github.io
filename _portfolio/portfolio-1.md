1. Introduction 
This project aims to model a hydraulic system for an aircraft landing gear using OpenModelica software.  
The work began with research aimed at obtaining a broad overview of the various types and functions of these devices, then moved on to a survey of the state of the art of current hydraulic circuits in today's aircraft.  
This was followed by an initial modeling of a simple circuit on the software with continuous research on the data to be entered into the various components during modeling, trying to respect the actual operating conditions.  
The project is concluded by presenting the results obtained.

1.1 Landing Gear

An aircraft landing gear is a mechanical system consisting of a retractable frame, mounted on wheels, that supports an aircraft when it is not in flight.  
Its purpose is to provide a suspension system during taxiing, takeoff and landing. It is designed to absorb and dissipate the kinetic energy of impact, thereby reducing the loads transmitted to the airframe.  
The landing gear is also largely responsible for braking the aircraft by means of a wheel braking system and provides directional control of the aircraft on the ground by means of a wheel steering system.
