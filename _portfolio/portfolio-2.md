## 1. Introduction  

The project consists of the construction of a tower crane for construction use. Starting with a design with calculations and ending with the actual 3D design using SolidWorks software.

The ideal configuration in such cases is that of a grafted-element crane, which is characterized by considerable heights, very long booms, and high loading capacity. Therefore, the crane will consist of a vertical structure (**tower**) that consists of a metal truss that performs a static beam support function; the horizontal part is divided into the part intended for load distribution (**boom**) and the part for load balancing (**counter-boom**).   

## 2. Technical Specifications

| Symbol | Description                         | Value  |
|--------|-------------------------------------|--------|
| H      | Maximum Height                      | 50 m   |
| h      | Maximum Load Lifting                | 40 m   |
| L      | Length of Arm + Counter-boom        | 60 m   |
| P      | Load at Maximum Extension           | 9800 N |  

## 3. Counter-boom

![calcoli-gru02](/images/calcoli-gru02.jpeg){:.align-center width="400px"}  

| Component             | Symbol | Mass (kg) |
|-----------------------|--------|-----------|
| Arm Mass              | m_b    | 4600      |
| Counter-boom Mass     | m_c    | 4700      |
| Upper Structure Mass  | m_s    | 5200      |
| Trolley Mass          | -      | 76        |
| Block Mass            | -      | 28        |  

The mass of concrete blocks `𝑚_R` is calculated so as to minimize the distance of the center of mass from the axis of symmetry of the vertical crane structure so as to have a low overturning moment.  

After a few iterations, `𝑚_𝑅 = 9000 kg` is obtained as the distance in the two minimum configurations, resulting in a low overturning moment.  
$x_{\text {Gi }}=-0.88 \mathrm{~m}$  
$x_{\text {Gf }}=-0.89 \mathrm{~m}$  

## 4. Basement  

![assieme-gru-07](/images/assieme-gru-07.png){:.align-center width="200px"}  
![calcoli-gru06](/images/calcoli-gru06.jpeg){:.align-center width="400px"}  

Calculation of center of mass:  
$x_{\text {G }}=\frac{1}{m_{\text {tot }}} * (m_{\text {b }}x_{\text {b }} + m_{\text {Q }}x_{\text {Q }} - m_{\text {c }}x_{\text {c }} - m_{\text {R }}x_{\text {R }})$

with m_tot = 43300 kg is obtained:  
$x_{\text {Gi }}=-0.5 \mathrm{~m}$  
$x_{\text {Gf }}=0.5 \mathrm{~m}$ 

Therefore, the overturning moment on the base is:  
$M_{\text {f,rot }} = 43300 \mathrm{~kg} * 9.81 \mathrm{~m/s^2} * 0.5 \mathrm{~m} = 214.4 \mathrm{~kN m}$ 

The resulting compression force transmitted to the ground is:  
$F_{\text {tot }} = 43300 \mathrm{~kg} * 9.81 \mathrm{~m/s^2} = 424.8 \mathrm{~kN }$ 

There are 4 supports for the tower, so the force on each beam is thus:  
$F = \frac{424.8 \mathrm{~kN}}{4} = 106.2 \mathrm{~kN }$ 

### Slewing ring   

![rallaruotadentata](/images/rallaruotadentata.PNG){:.align-center width="300px"}  

The slewing ring was selected from a manufacturers' catalog code: 'EB2.35.1249.400-1SPPN' with the characteristics shown in the table:  

| De   | de   | di   | Di   | Dx   | He   | Hi   | Ht   | Hd   | Fe   | Fi   | N    | V    | L    | W    | m    | Z    | Dp   |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [mm] | [-]  | [-]  |[mm]  | [-]  | [-]  | [mm] | [-]  | [mm] |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 1472 | 1252 | 1246 | 1085 | 1406 | 134  | 134  | 144  | 115  | 1350 | 1150 | 36   | 28   | 41   | 27   | 14   | 102  | 1428 |  

Material of the ring: steel 42CrMo4 (`𝜎_𝑅 = 900 N/mm^2`)  

- Starting torque: `C_d = C_rv + C_rc`  
`C_rv` = idle resistance torque with compressed bearing components  
`C_rc` = constant rotation torque due to loads  

- Torque with acceleration: `C_g = C_rv + C_rc + C_a`  
`C_a` = acceleration torque  

Resulting in:  
$C_{\text {rc }} = 3.7 \mathrm{~kN m}$ 


From technical specifications the maximum rotational speed is equal to:  
$𝜔 = 0.7 \mathrm{~rad/min } = 0.01167 \mathrm{~rad/s }$ 

For the moment of inertia, all the weight concentrated at the center of gravity of the entire structure is considered  
$I = m * d^2 = 19486 \mathrm{~kg m^2 }$ 

Assuming the acceleration time of 1s is obtained:  
$C_{\text {a }}=0.227 \mathrm{~kN m}$ 

From a graph is obtained that:   
$C_{\text {rv }}=0.5 \mathrm{~kN m}$   

So, finally:  
$C_{\text {d }}=4.3 \mathrm{~kN m}$  $C_{\text {g }}=4.5 \mathrm{~kN m}$ 

### Check   

Lastly a check was made of the slewing ring & drive wheel teeth, where the maximum torque to be transmitted is  
$C_{\text {g }}=4.5 \mathrm{~kN m}$  

### Check of the shaft of the drive wheel  

![Albero](/images/Albero.PNG){:.align-center width="250px"}  
![calcoli-gru13](/images/calcoli-gru13.jpeg){:.align-center width="300px"}  

Material of the shaft: steel 42CrMo4 (`𝜎_𝑅 = 900 N/mm^2`)    

$M_{\text {f,max }}=4250 \mathrm{~kN mm}$  
$C_{\text {t }}=4760 \mathrm{~kN mm}$  


### Check of the screws   

![Bulloniralla](/images/Bulloniralla.PNG){:.align-center width="200px"}  

36 screws M27 x 155 - 8.8 (`𝜎_𝑅 = 800 N/mm^2`)  

A check was made both on compression and traction.  

### Check of the rope for the trolley movement   

![carrello](/images/carrello.PNG){:.align-center width="300px"}  
![calcoli-gru09](/images/calcoli-gru09.jpeg){:.align-center width="450px"}  
![calcoli-gru07](/images/calcoli-gru07.jpeg){:.align-center width="300px"}  

A maximum carriage travel speed equal: $v=40 \mathrm{~m/min}=0.667 \mathrm{~m/s}$ was choosen.  

The maximum force to be applied to move the trolley when the load is maximum:  
$F=𝜇_{\text {S }} * P = 0.4 * 10.8 \mathrm{~kN }=4.32 \mathrm{~kN }$  

The rope is then chosen from a supplier's catalog that states the following:  

| Diameter of the rope [mm] | External wire diameter [mm] | Weight per meter [g] | Minimum breaking load [kN] |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| 5                         | 1.68                        | 125                  | 24.8                       |  

### Choice of the winch for the trolley movement

### Check of the rope for the load lifting  

![calcoli-gru08](/images/calcoli-gru08.jpeg){:.align-center width="450px"}  

To verify the choice of rope used to lift the load, the maximum stresses acting on it are sought.     

The same rope chosen for trolley movement is choosen.

### Check of the following shaft

## 5. Study of the arm structure  

![braccio](/images/braccio.PNG){:.align-center width="300px"}  
![calcoli-gru19](/images/calcoli-gru19.jpeg){:.align-center width="300px"}  

The standard: UNI-EN 13001-2:2015 it was taken as a reference.  

This part required a lot of calculation. The structure was divided into elementary structures and equilibrium was made at each node. Some design assumptions were made. e.g. The wind force is neglected as a first approximation.  

Finally, the forces transmitted to the next part of the arm are calculated.   

To find the value of the tie-rod forces, equilibrium of moments is imposed on the complete boom structure with center of reduction at the attachment of the vertical structure.  

A better evaluation of the forces that also considers the effects of wind and different positions of the trolley along the boom can be done through a finite element analysis.  

Laslty a check on the weld of the arm connection plate was done.  

## 6. Study of the counter-boom

![Controbraccio](/images/Controbraccio.PNG){:.align-center width="300px"}  
![calcoli-gru20](/images/calcoli-gru20.jpeg){:.align-center width="300px"}  

A procedure similar to the previous arm but much more easy, due to the lack of the triangle structure, is carried out. Force distribution easier to understand.  

Laslty a check on the weld of the counter-boom connection plate was done.
