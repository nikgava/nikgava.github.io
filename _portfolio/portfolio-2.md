## 1. Introduction  

The project consists of the realization of a tower crane for construction use, the ideal configuration in such cases is that of a grafted-element crane, characterized by considerable heights, very long booms, and high load capacities. Therefore, the crane will consist of a vertical structure (**tower**) that consists of a metal truss that performs a static function of supporting the girder, the horizontal part is divided into the part intended for load distribution (**boom**) and that for load balancing (**counter-boom**).
