## 1. Introduction  

This project aims to model a hydraulic system for an aircraft landing gear using OpenModelica software.  

The work began with research aimed at obtaining a broad overview of the various types and functions of these devices, then moved on to a survey of the state of the art of current hydraulic circuits in today's aircraft.  

This was followed by an initial modeling of a simple circuit on the software with continuous research on the data to be entered into the various components during modeling, trying to respect the actual operating conditions.  

The project is concluded by presenting the results obtained.

### 1.1 Landing Gear
