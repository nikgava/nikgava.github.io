### Work  

I am an Industry Process Consultant at [Dassault Systèmes](https://www.3ds.com/it/) in Milan, working within the [SIMULIA](https://www.3ds.com/it/prodotti-e-servizi/simulia/) team. I support clients in transitioning to the 3DEXPERIENCE platform, a unified environment that enhances engineering, simulation, and collaboration. My role bridges technical expertise and business consulting, helping companies workflows, improve efficiency, and adopt innovative solutions. By understanding customer needs, I guide them in optimizing processes and maximizing the value of digital transformation.

### Education  

My path began with a high school education at a technical institute in *Pistoia*, my hometown. I then moved to *Florence* to attend a bachelor's degree in **mechanical engineering** at the [Università degli studi di Firenze](https://www.ing-mel.unifi.it/). Finally, I moved to *Modena* to pursue a master's degree in **automotive engineering** at the [Università degli studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia](https://www.ingmo.unimore.it/site/home/didattica/lauree/ingegneria-del-veicolo.html).

### My interests 

I have a strong passion for engineering, especially in the *automotive* sector, and a deep curiosity for technology and its impact on industries. Beyond the technical world, I’m particularly interested in *startups* and entrepreneurship, fascinated by innovation, and the process of turning ideas into reality. I also follow markets and personal finance, always eager to understand trends and new opportunities.

If I had to describe myself in one word, it would be "**curious**”!
