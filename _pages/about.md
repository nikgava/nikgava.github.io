### Work  

I am currently working as a Industry Process Consultant (internship) at [Dassault Systèmes](https://www.3ds.com/it/) in Milan. My team, [SIMULIA](https://www.3ds.com/it/prodotti-e-servizi/simulia/) is involved in providing consultancy services by developing customer specific Finite Element Models and Optimization analyses for a wide range of industries (automotive, aerospace, defense, marine, geotechnical, offshore, etc.).  

### Education  

My path began with a high school education at a technical institute in *Pistoia*, my hometown. I then moved to *Florence* to attend a bachelor's degree in **mechanical engineering** at the [Università degli studi di Firenze](https://www.ing-mel.unifi.it/). Finally, I moved to *Modena* to pursue a master's degree in **automotive engineering** at the [Università degli studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia](https://www.ingmo.unimore.it/site/home/didattica/lauree/ingegneria-del-veicolo.html).

### My interests 

I am interested in engineering subjects, especially *automotive*, but also *rail* and *space*, and anything remotely related to *technology*. In addition, I am a big fan of both *markets* and *personal finance*. 

If I had to reduce myself to one word I would most likely choose "**curious**”!
