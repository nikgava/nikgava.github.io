I am currently working as a Industry Process Consultant at [Dassault Systèmes](https://www.3ds.com/it/) in Milan. My team, [SIMULIA](https://www.3ds.com/it/prodotti-e-servizi/simulia/) is involved in providing consultancy services by developing customer specific Finite Element Models and Optimization analyses for a wide range of industries (automotive, aerospace, defense, marine, geotechnical, offshore, etc.).  

Bachelor's degree in **mechanical engineering** -> done  
Master's degree in **automotive engineering** -> exams: finished, graduation date: April  

I am interested in engineering topics, especially in automotive but also in rail and space; finance and anything that comes remotely in contact with technology.  

If I had to reduce myself to one word I would most likely choose "**curious**”!
